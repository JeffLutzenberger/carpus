======

Carpus is a particle manipulation game (currently) about manipulating a particle stream into a "knot-like" configuration. 

The game uses a custom OpenGL rendering engine. It uses an offscreen buffer and a Gaussian blur shader to produce a glow (bloom) effect and a smoke effect. 

Here are a few screenshots of the most recent version:

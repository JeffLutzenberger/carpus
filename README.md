carpus
======

Carpus is a particle manipulation game where you attempt to create knots by directing particles. Knot configurations include:

- Unknot or Loop
- Trefoil
- Figure Eight
- ...

The game uses a custom OpenGL rendering engine. It currently uses an offscreen buffer and a Gaussian blur shader to produce a glow (bloom) effect and a smoke effect.
